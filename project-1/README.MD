# Problem Statement 2 : Design a Carousel with Fallback Image

Objective: Develop an image carousel component for a web application that displays a
series of images in a sliding format. The carousel should include functionality to navigate
through the images and handle cases where an image is not available by showing a fallback
image instead. This component should be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Requirements:

1. Carousel Structure:
   ○ The carousel should display a series of images in a horizontal sliding format.
   ○ Include navigation controls (e.g., next and previous buttons) to cycle through
   the images.
   ○ Optionally, provide indicators (e.g., dots or thumbnails) to show the current
   image and allow direct navigation.
2. Image Handling:
   ○ Implement functionality to handle cases where an image fails to load.
   ○ Display a fallback image (a default placeholder image) in place of any image
   that cannot be loaded.
3. Animations:
   ○ Include smooth transitions or animations when navigating between images.
   ○ Ensure that the animations are fluid and visually pleasing.
4. Responsiveness:
   ○ The carousel should be responsive and display correctly on both desktop and
   mobile devices.
   ○ The design should adapt to various screen sizes without compromising
5. Fallback Image:
   ○ Define a default placeholder image to be used when an image fails to load.
   ○ Ensure the fallback image is clearly visible and appropriate for use in place of
   a missing image.
6. Styling:
   ○ Design the carousel to be visually appealing and consistent with modern web
   design trends.
   ○ Provide basic styling for the navigation controls, indicators, and the carousel
   container, but allow for customization.
   Deliverables:
7. Code:
   ○ Complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the carousel component.
   ○ Ensure the code is well-commented and adheres to best practices.
8. Demo:
   ○ A working demo of the carousel component hosted online or provided as a
   local file.
   ○ Demonstrate functionality including image navigation, fallback image display,
   and responsiveness
